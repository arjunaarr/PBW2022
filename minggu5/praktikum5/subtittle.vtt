1
00:00:03.034 --> 00:00:09.000
An ordinary story, with a spice of magic.

2
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:14.700
Two-dimensional world between finger and table.

3
00:00:15.034 --> 00:00:21.000
The person who is left behind and the smartest person in the class.

4
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:26.566
Living in a dimension under the same cloud.

5
00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:29.633
And then came the four-dimensional world.

6
00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:35.966
Even the machine will shed tears.

7
00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:42.733
And give a trembling cry for courage.

8
00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:43.499
So,

9
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.633
we came together.

10
00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:49.100
To start an adventurous journey together.

11
00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:54.733
Even if you are nothing, let's save the world.

12
00:00:54.734 --> 00:01:00.866
One day, as time goes on, I'm sure I'll get there.

13
00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:04.466
So I will meet.

14
00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:08.033
Do do do do do do do do do do Doraemon.

15
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Four Dimensional Vertical Block.

16
00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:26.900
Wow, heavy...

17
00:01:30.862 --> 00:01:32.906
Then, the next new game...

18
00:01:32.906 --> 00:01:34.866
Out of business!

19
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:37.869
The first round begins!

20
00:02:04.854 --> 00:02:06.856
Nobita?!

21
00:02:07.857 --> 00:02:10.860
Don't mess around on the second floor!

22
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.947
Ah, what dust is this!

23
00:02:13.947 --> 00:02:15.949
- Mama.
- Mama.

24
00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.867
Stop it now!

25
00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:19.869
Hah...

26
00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:23.873
Huh, even though I just wanted to play...

27
00:02:23.873 --> 00:02:25.959
I want to play more...

28
00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.877
There he is!

29
00:02:27.877 --> 00:02:30.964
We get scolded because we did
second floor. Let's do it on the third floor!

30
00:02:30.964 --> 00:02:32.882
Uh, the third floor doesn't exist...

31
00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:43.893
If you do this between
the first and second floor slabs of our house...

32
00:02:43.893 --> 00:02:45.895
That will increase the number of additional floors.

33
00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:48.898
Uh?

34
00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:53.069
Now, we have three floors.

35
00:02:53.903 --> 00:02:55.905
Lie...

36
00:02:56.906 --> 00:02:58.867
Uh?

37
00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:01.870
There are still stairs...

38
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.872
Through this way...

39
00:03:04.873 --> 00:03:06.875
Try to open.

40
00:03:09.878 --> 00:03:12.922
Wow great!

41
00:03:12.922 --> 00:03:16.885
We have this new room in between
first and second floors.

42
00:03:16.885 --> 00:03:18.887
It means...

43
00:03:18.887 --> 00:03:21.890
Yes, no matter how brutal it is
you are noisy above...

44
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.892
Won't be heard on the first floor!

45
00:03:23.892 --> 00:03:25.894
Alright, let's start the match!

46
00:03:28.855 --> 00:03:31.024
You did, huh?

47
00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.861
- Feel this!
- Oh.

48
00:03:34.861 --> 00:03:36.863
What...

49
00:03:37.864 --> 00:03:42.869
It seems, there is a child who made
commotion, but who is it?

50
00:03:44.913 --> 00:03:46.915
That's great.

51
00:03:46.915 --> 00:03:49.876
It's the first time I can
have fun like this!

52
00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:51.878
And mama won't be mad at us!

53
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:58.885
- I want to drink some water first!
- Yes.

54
00:03:59.886 --> 00:04:03.890
The first floor is far, but...

55
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:08.853
Oh yes!

56
00:04:08.853 --> 00:04:10.855
Let's call Shizuka-chan too!

57
00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:12.857
Doraemon~!

58
00:04:12.857 --> 00:04:16.861
- I'm out for a second!
- Okay!

59
00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:18.863
Uh?

60
00:04:19.863 --> 00:04:22.951
It should be three stories high...

61
00:04:22.951 --> 00:04:26.996
Since it's four-dimensional, if you
look at it from the outside, it will look like that.

62
00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:35.922
- So much fun playing out of business.
- Uh, what?

63
00:04:35.922 --> 00:04:38.883
Do you want to change the futon? That's great!
(Note: Shizuka misinterpreted Nobita's word)

64
00:04:38.883 --> 00:04:41.886
Yes, yes! Yes, right?
Lets do it!

65
00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:44.847
I don't want to play out of business, but...

66
00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:47.850
I want a study room
be calm.

67
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.146
Please, please...
The second floor is empty.

68
00:04:57.443 --> 00:04:58.862
It's a beautiful room.

69
00:04:58.862 --> 00:05:00.864
It just finished.

70
00:05:04.868 --> 00:05:07.120
I'm going out for a bit, but...

71
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.872
Don't play the block to your heart's content!

72
00:05:08.872 --> 00:05:12.000
Because when you do,
nothing good will happen.

73
00:05:17.046 --> 00:05:20.884
When you say that,
I want to do it again!

74
00:05:20.884 --> 00:05:23.887
Oh yes!

75
00:05:24.888 --> 00:05:27.891
I will increase the room,
to turn into an apartment!

76
00:05:29.934 --> 00:05:31.978
This way okay!
(Poster writing: 100yen per month)

77
00:05:31.978 --> 00:05:34.939
- Rent it to me.
- Suneo?

78
00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:38.860
I want to read comics at home,
but my mom is noisy

79
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.862
So, I want to use it
as a comic reading room!

80
00:05:40.862 --> 00:05:42.864
Please, please...

81
00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:46.868
Let's make a four-story building like this...

82
00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:49.871
I will rent out the third floor
new for you.

83
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:51.873
Ha...

84
00:05:51.873 --> 00:05:55.877
Hey, I like it~!

85
00:05:56.878 --> 00:06:00.882
- Here, the rent is for one year.
- Ready!

86
00:06:01.841 --> 00:06:04.886
Ah Nobita-san, what a coincidence...

87
00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:07.889
- Would you like some tea?
- With pleasure...

88
00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:12.852
Thank you for giving me
quiet room.

89
00:06:12.852 --> 00:06:14.938
Thanks to you, I can learn.

90
00:06:14.938 --> 00:06:18.858
Well, as long as Shizuka-chan is happy...

91
00:06:18.858 --> 00:06:20.860
You can stay as long as you like.

92
00:06:21.945 --> 00:06:23.947
Oh no!

93
00:06:24.864 --> 00:06:26.866
What?

94
00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:31.871
It's a lie, right?

95
00:06:31.871 --> 00:06:33.873
There is development here...

96
00:06:33.873 --> 00:06:37.919
Stay cool,
I will do something soon!

97
00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:41.881
Nobita, I rented because of me
want a quiet room!

98
00:06:41.881 --> 00:06:44.884
- Do something!
- Okay!

99
00:06:45.885 --> 00:06:48.012
Rent me too!

100
00:06:48.012 --> 00:06:49.889
Ah!

101
00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:54.852
I'm suddenly busy.

102
00:06:56.896 --> 00:06:58.898
Nine storey building...

103
00:06:58.898 --> 00:07:02.861
If it was this high, there would be no sound of development.

104
00:07:03.903 --> 00:07:05.864
Shizuka-chan is on the eighth floor.

105
00:07:05.864 --> 00:07:09.868
It's quiet, and the view is great.
Thank you~!

106
00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:13.079
Suneo on the seventh floor.

107
00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:16.082
I actually prefer the top floor...

108
00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.877
Gian is on the 6th floor.

109
00:07:18.877 --> 00:07:21.880
But, what are you going to do in this room?

110
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.884
What will I do in the room
what I rented has nothing to do with you, right?

111
00:07:25.884 --> 00:07:28.052
That's true, but...

112
00:07:28.052 --> 00:07:30.889
In that case, the rental fee is 100 yen...

113
00:07:35.894 --> 00:07:37.896
So that's it, yeah...

114
00:07:43.026 --> 00:07:45.862
As expected, he acted recklessly.

115
00:07:45.862 --> 00:07:47.989
Nobita!

116
00:07:47.989 --> 00:07:49.991
Bring back the vertical block!

117
00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:54.871
Can't even climb the stairs...

118
00:08:00.877 --> 00:08:02.879
Nobita!

119
00:08:06.883 --> 00:08:08.885
I feel better today.

120
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.892
After the sound of development, then the voice of Gian!

121
00:08:15.892 --> 00:08:18.937
I can be crazy.
And I'm going to faint!

122
00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:21.856
Is there nothing that can be done?

123
00:08:21.856 --> 00:08:23.858
I understand...

124
00:08:23.858 --> 00:08:25.902
Added a few more rooms in the middle.

125
00:08:38.873 --> 00:08:42.961
I want to rent a room...

126
00:08:42.961 --> 00:08:44.963
Hah?

127
00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:50.843
With this, the problem is solved...

128
00:08:50.843 --> 00:08:52.887
Uh, who's that?

129
00:08:52.887 --> 00:08:54.847
Look here,
"I'll rent it to you."

130
00:08:54.847 --> 00:08:56.849
What's this!

131
00:08:57.892 --> 00:08:59.894
Nobita!

132
00:09:02.897 --> 00:09:04.899
- So, the room...
- I'm not renting it to you!

133
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.863
Nobita!

134
00:09:09.863 --> 00:09:11.865
Oh, how's this...
What to do...

135
00:09:11.865 --> 00:09:13.908
There he is!

136
00:09:13.908 --> 00:09:16.870
Escape higher and higher...

137
00:09:23.877 --> 00:09:25.879
Strange...

138
00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:29.883
No matter how many stairs
what I climbed, the stairs...

139
00:09:29.883 --> 00:09:32.886
How can this be...

140
00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:38.850
Not strong...

141
00:09:41.895 --> 00:09:44.856
It should be safe now.

142
00:09:44.856 --> 00:09:50.862
Wow amazing!
It becomes a skyscraper!

143
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.867
Toilets, toilets...

144
00:09:55.867 --> 00:09:57.869
It's only on the first floor.

145
00:09:58.912 --> 00:10:01.915
How much do I go down the stairs,
it won't end!

146
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.878
Uh, Doraemon?

147
00:10:06.878 --> 00:10:11.883
Nobita, give me back my block...

148
00:10:11.883 --> 00:10:14.010
Oh, sorry...

149
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.888
Now is not the time.

150
00:10:16.888 --> 00:10:20.892
Nobita, I want to rent a few more rooms...

151
00:10:20.892 --> 00:10:24.896
Uh, nothing?
In that case...

152
00:10:24.896 --> 00:10:26.898
Hurry up!

153
00:10:26.898 --> 00:10:29.901
I'm sure soon...

154
00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:34.906
Nobita, give me back my block...

155
00:10:34.906 --> 00:10:37.867
What does this mean?

156
00:10:37.867 --> 00:10:39.911
Did someone move the block...

157
00:10:39.911 --> 00:10:42.872
Game room and collection room...

158
00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:49.879
Next, let Gian get lost...

159
00:10:55.885 --> 00:10:59.889
I can not take it anymore...

160
00:10:59.889 --> 00:11:03.893
That's why even though I said,
that wouldn't be a good thing.

161
00:11:12.861 --> 00:11:14.863
Press button d...

162
00:11:14.863 --> 00:11:17.866
Choose the face of Goo Choki Par and win!

163
00:11:17.866 --> 00:11:20.869
Collect points and win prizes!

164
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.200
Safe, gian insurance.

165
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.850
Finally, I got the newest edition...

166
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.830
On a rainy day, on a windy day, on a thunderous day...

167
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.850
Save 10 yen without
missed a day.

168
00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:57.820
Finally able to buy...

169
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.900
Isn't that Nobita-kun, is it?

170
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.820
What do you want, Gian?

171
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.870
I saw...

172
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.810
Gorogoro latest edition...

173
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.910
Lend!

174
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.900
Dora...

175
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.820
Why is it always not there when I'm in trouble like this.

176
00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.820
Uh, dorayaki.

177
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.820
I am home!

178
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.900
Ah!

179
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.830
My Dorayaki...

180
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.820
Though I want to eat it
after i get home...

181
00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.790
After all, you put it...

182
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.810
In a place like this...

183
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:41.880
You are really...

184
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.810
But, come on.

185
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.810
Uh, really?

186
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.820
Hello, are you an insurance?

187
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.800
- Please come now!
- What's that?

188
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.880
- Any insurance.
- What insurance?

189
00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.810
Oh, he's coming!

190
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.810
I am a partner to help anywhere.

191
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.810
Any insurance.

192
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.810
- Thank you for your hard work.
- It's about Dorayaki insurance.

193
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:21.820
- Yes that's right...
- What is Dorayaki Insurance?

194
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.800
- Well, just watch.
- Uh?

195
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.870
That's me!

196
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.790
I feel sorry for you

197
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.820
Agreed, please accept this!

198
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.820
Well, sorry to bother you.

199
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.820
How come?

200
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.810
What is called insurance is
pay a little money for emergencies.

201
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.810
No refund if
nothing happened...

202
00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.810
However, in case of an accident or illness...

203
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:56.920
You will receive more
money than the amount paid.

204
00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.800
Insurance in the future can also
pay for it in kind.

205
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.810
Recently I ate Dorayaki every day...

206
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.940
So, I insured it.

207
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.810
However, I only ate one.

208
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.970
The dorayaki he was looking forward to eating...

209
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.890
It was part of the wound in his heart.

210
00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:21.930
Hey, can I insure too?

211
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.930
Nobita-kun?
What insurance?

212
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.820
Gian Insurance!

213
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.890
Gian Insurance?
Can you do that?

214
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.890
Leave it to me!

215
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.810
How about a contract like this...

216
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.810
You will be charged 10 yen per day.

217
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:47.820
50 yen if I get hit, 30 yen if
I got kicked, 15 yen for the rest...

218
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.800
- Hey...
- But, it costs a lot.

219
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.810
After all I was beaten every day...

220
00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.940
If I can earn money
by beating...

221
00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:58.810
- Isn't this much better?
- That's true, but...

222
00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.810
Is it like this?

223
00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.890
Thank you for signing
Gian's insurance contract.

224
00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.820
Now, please pay for today first.

225
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.820
Okay!

226
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.810
- Ha ha ha!
- After all, that's my comic!

227
00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.820
Better stop...

228
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.820
Isn't insurance prepared for this?

229
00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.840
Ah, well that's true, but...

230
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.840
- Okay!
- Ah, nobita-kun...

231
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.810
- Ha ha ha...
- Gianna!

232
00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:31.810
Bring back that manga!

233
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.830
What did you say?!

234
00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.950
After all, that's my comic...

235
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:43.810
What is yours is mine!
Mine is mine!

236
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:49.890
- Base...
- Nobita-kun, are you okay?

237
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.810
Yes, this one...

238
00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.820
Hello, are you an insurance?

239
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:04.810
I am a partner to help anywhere.
Any insurance!

240
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:07.810
Ah, this is too scary...

241
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.800
I feel sorry for you.

242
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.810
Approved.

243
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:21.810
I'm grateful.

244
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.820
I've been beaten a lot, but...

245
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.800
Thanks to that, I was able to buy new comics.

246
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.810
It was because everything was already prepared.

247
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.810
Hey, if 10 yen were changed to 20 yen...

248
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.810
Can I get double compensation?

249
00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:40.810
Yes, but do you have that much money?

250
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:44.800
If I get hit by Gian every day,
I can read all comics.

251
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.810
You can't do that!

252
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.810
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Can't what, something good?

253
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:57.220
Where's Gian?

254
00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:01.260
Oh, there!

255
00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.230
- Nobita, be careful!
- Uh?

256
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.230
After the test results are shared,
he was like that.

257
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:09.250
If you don't want to be beaten by him,
better stay away...

258
00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:12.250
- Really?
- Uh?

259
00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.309
Yo, Gian.

260
00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:19.210
If you're upset,
what if you hit me?

261
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.210
Nobita...

262
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:25.319
Look at this!

263
00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:29.320
Is it because of my hard work?

264
00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:34.290
Well, it turns out you're in a good mood, huh?

265
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:41.230
Forget it, tomorrow will definitely change
back to Gian who likes to beat people.

266
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.220
Alright, today...

267
00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.220
Oh, Gian!

268
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.220
He's been like that from the start.

269
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.230
If you don't want to be beaten
Be quiet...

270
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.230
- Gianna!
- Hey...

271
00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.280
Gian.

272
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.200
Noisy ah...

273
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.220
- I got the flu...
- Uh?

274
00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.190
Look, didn't you hit me?

275
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:12.210
- How could I want...
- Impossible!

276
00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.200
Uh, you got more?!

277
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.290
I just bought Dorayaki,
but there is no red bean in it...

278
00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.290
Then, I insured it!

279
00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:27.210
- That's cheating, Doraemon!
- What about Gian?

280
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:31.300
- I wasn't beaten after insuring her.
- In that case, good.

281
00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.230
Alright.
Can't I get the money?

282
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:37.230
Insurance doesn't work like that.

283
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.200
Where are you going?

284
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.210
Is there a better way?

285
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.200
Uh, Shizuka-chan?

286
00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.220
- Ah, Nobita-san.
- What is it?

287
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.220
This, after being borrowed by Takeshi...

288
00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.320
Wow, here it is!

289
00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.210
Uh?

290
00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:01.260
It's not Nobita's book, right?

291
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.260
Give me the contract!

292
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:09.240
- This...
- Thank you.

293
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.240
Hello, are you an insurance?

294
00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:18.210
Look, my book was dirty with Gian.

295
00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.200
In that case, I will investigate.

296
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.220
This...

297
00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.240
Any insurance, do not accept
any cheating!

298
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.190
That's why I told you...

299
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.190
- In that case...
- Wait a moment!

300
00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.200
This one was destroyed by Gian.

301
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.220
- It wasn't intentional.
- Uh?

302
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:48.270
If this, it's a hole when Gian chases it...

303
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.210
This is because of the lifetime of the socks.

304
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:53.250
Impossible...
Oh yes!

305
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:57.250
If this is really broken by Gian.

306
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.240
Look!

307
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.240
I feel sorry for you.

308
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.210
- Not accepted!
- Uh, why?

309
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:13.250
This incident happened before signing the contract!

310
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.250
Impossible...

311
00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:19.220
In that case, please pay today in advance.

312
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.220
Have a nice day!

313
00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:34.250
You don't have any more money, do you?

314
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.320
This is the last option.

315
00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.210
Please, Gian!

316
00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:46.220
Hit me!

317
00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.200
- Nobita-kun...
- What did you say?!

318
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.240
Please, please...
Now hit me!

319
00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.210
Even if you suddenly say
to hit you...

320
00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:59.210
Then at least kick me!

321
00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:02.420
Hey, stop it!

322
00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:06.220
Don't want to!
I won't stop until you hit me!

323
00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.220
Well, if you insist on that...

324
00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:11.210
- I'll hit you.
- Yuhu~!

325
00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:15.210
- Thank you, Gian.
- Hey, hey, stop...

326
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:20.220
All right, get ready!

327
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.340
Lets do it!

328
00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.220
Takeshi!

329
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.210
Ma-Mama?!

330
00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.200
Do you want to hit again?

331
00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.220
No really, it's because Nobita said
if he wants me to hit him.

332
00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.200
- Do not lie!
- That's right...

333
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.210
Impossible...

334
00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.220
Are you still saying that?

335
00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:50.280
Oh, I'm stopping, I'm stopping!

336
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.220
If you are diligent in saving,
You can buy manga.

337
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.220
No longer!
I will stop this kind of insurance!

338
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.220
Uh?

339
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.230
Ah, the relief...

340
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.230
Gi-Gian...

341
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.200
Nobita, because of you...

342
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.290
I was scolded by my mother...

343
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.210
Dora...

344
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:23.260
Didn't you just say that
you want me to hit you?

345
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.260
Cancel!
I don't have insurance anymore!

346
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:32.280
I don't understand what you're saying!

347
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:40.230
Why is this happening?

348
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:42.230
Geez...

349
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:49.320
Your dream is my dream!

350
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.290
Let's start!
"Gian's Dream"!

351
00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.310
Saturday, 5 pm, Doraemon...

352
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:58.210
Hide and seek?

353
00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:00.290
This is a tool that no one can see.

354
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:02.250
Who threw the ball?!

355
00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.230
That is not me!

356
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.240
Get started!

357
00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:35.230
Because I'm scissors
I win!

358
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.230
See you next week!
